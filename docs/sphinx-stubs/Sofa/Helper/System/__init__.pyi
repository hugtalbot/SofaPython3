    Helper class to find files in a list of directories.

    1: Using the specified filename in current directory, or in the specified directory.
    If the filename does not start with "/", "./", or "../" :
    2: In the directory path specified using addFirstPath method.
    3: In the directory path specified using an environment variable (default to SOFA_DATA_PATH).
    4: In the default directories relative to the main executable (default to ../share).
    5: In the directory path specified using addLastPath method.

    For file name starting with '/', './' or '../' only the first step is used.
    A path is considered as a concatenation of directories separated by : on linux / mac and ; on windows
